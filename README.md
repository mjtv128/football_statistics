# football_statistics

We have a spreadsheet of football matches in a season. Every row, we have date, home team, away team, home goals, away goals, winner and referee. 

Winner column is either H, A or D. (Home, Array, Draw)

Take all the data in the spreadsheet in CSV format and load up data in a node js application and going to parse the data to analyse and report it in a HTML and in the terminal.

This will use both inheritance and composition to parse and analyse the data. ( more on composition)
